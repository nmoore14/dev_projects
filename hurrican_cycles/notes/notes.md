# Huricane Cycles Notes
### August 15, 2019
- After a discussion with Charter earlier in the year regarding their free business hosting, we are limited in what tech we can use.
	- They only offer PHP 5
	- Only 2gb of storage
- We will be using a LAMP stack with jQuery.

### Dev Environment
- Any laptop / computer
- LAMP, MAMP, XAMP, AMPPS - any linux php stack will do.
- jQuery and the newest version of Bootstrap (v4~)
