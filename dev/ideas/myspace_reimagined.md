# MySpace Re-Imagined
- MySpace like social media platform built with a new frontend framework (Vue, Svelte, or Angular).
- Users will still have the ability to customize the pages, just like the good ole days.
- Encourage the use of html, css, and some JS to help make the user feel more like they own their page.
